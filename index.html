        <h2> Visual Studio Code can provide necessary support for the purpose of debugging,shortcuts from keyboards, snippets, syntax highlights, in-built Git control, and termination. To get it set up you would have to download it on which computer or monitar you are using, then you would have to creat a folder to save your work and use the folder in visual studio and create a file. </h2>
        <h3>In the Console screen you can see what you have typed up and when you right click, click on the inspect button and you will be able to see your code. To open and print the console screen you would have to click on live test and you can print what you want. </h3>
